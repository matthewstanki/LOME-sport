                        <h2>Description:</h2><br>

                        <p>Fit is the foundation of fast. No matter how innovative a pair of football boots may be, if
                            the fit isn’t right, if the foot slides even 1 mm inside the boot, speed can be compromised.
                            For this reason, fit became the focal point in designing the new Mercurial, leading to its
                            game-changing 360 construction made possible through a new advancement in Nike Flyknit
                            technology.</p><br>

                        <p>The Mercurial Superfly 360 and Mercurial Vapor 360 wrap the entire foot in Nike Flyknit.
                            “This new innovation hugs the foot and eliminates the gaps between the foot and the
                            soleplate. In fact, it eliminates the soleplate altogether,” explains Max Blau, VP of Nike
                            Football Footwear.</p><br>

                        <p>Without a soleplate, the sockliner interlocks with a new internal chassis that is tuned for
                            maximum responsiveness. The chassis is individually tuned per size via computational
                            programming. “With previous Mercurials, we based everything on a size 9. But with Mercurial
                            360, we can deliver properly proportioned fit at every size,” explains Jeongwoo Lee, Nike
                            Football Senior Design Director. “Each size has a unique chassis designed to align with the
                            expected bone structure.”</p><br>

                        <p>Traction is provided by precisely placed studs in the forefoot and heel. Lee drew
                            inspiration from agile cheetahs and focused on traction at speed, leading to the minimalist
                            approach he affectionately refers to as the cheetah paw. “The aggressive forefoot is built
                            for acceleration in any direction while the heel studs help the player stop on a dime,”
                            notes Lee.</p><br>

                        <p>The reimagined underfoot of the boot is more than just visually stunning. “This boot is less
                            like a hoof, more like a claw,” explains Blau. “The feedback we get from players is that
                            there is a sensation that the boot just disappears in the way it syncs with the foot.”</p>
                        <br>

                        <p>Cristiano Ronaldo embraced the Mercurial Superfly 360 right away. “My first reaction when I
                            saw the new Mercurial was...the best boots ever! They fit straight away. The material, the
                            design, the new technology, it’s amazing,” he says.</p><br>

                        <p>The plush feel of the Mercurial 360 can also be attributed to advancements in Nike All
                            Conditions Control (ACC). Previously, ACC was applied on top of the finished Flyknit
                            product, creating a thin layer. Now, ACC is embedded into the yarns prior to knitting,
                            eliminating the additional skin without compromising the performance benefit. The result is
                            a matte finish on a texturized upper that is softer to the touch but can still battle the
                            elements.</p><br>

                        <p>For its 20th anniversary, the Mercurial adopts a clean aesthetic with a small forefoot
                            Swoosh and a bold “M” on the heel. “Mercurial players tend to be very fast, so that “M” is
                            the last thing defenders will see when a Mercurial player blows by them,” says Lee.</p><br>

                        <p>On the Mercurial Superfly 360, the Dynamic Fit Collar takes on a lower cuff, similar to the
                            modified version Ronaldo has preferred in recent seasons. Both the Superfly and Vapor
                            versions of Mercurial 360 feature a soft, one-piece internal lining, part of the effort to
                            reduce the number of boot components. “Mercurial is best when it’s minimal and streamlined,”
                            says Lee. “Design done right doesn’t require excess parts.”</p><br>

                        <p>For 20 years, Nike has designed Mercurial boots for the fastest players in the game,
                            featuring experimental and game-changing innovations. Mercurial 360 builds on that proud
                            tradition with a 360 construction that will soon appear in Nike footwear across other
                            sports.</p><br>

                        <p>Mercurial Superfly 360 and Mercurial Vapor 360 will debut on pitch this weekend and will be
                            available February 14 on nike.com.<br>
