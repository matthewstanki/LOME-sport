                        <p style="font-family:verdana;font-weight:bold;color: black;">
                            For many years, Bethany has been baking the most delicious pies at her home. In 2013, we
                            opened
                            our
                            first
                            store in Brussels (Belgium) in a cosy little street near the Grand Market. People from all
                            over
                            the
                            world fell in love
                            with the soft cakes, heavenly cheese cakes, spicy apple pies... The store became a success
                            in no
                            time.
                            In 2015, no less than 100 pies were sold every day and Bethany's Pie Shop moved into a
                            larger
                            building.
                            After receiving many requests, it became clear that our next step was making it possible to
                            order
                            pies from the
                            comfort of your own home and from anywhere in the world. You are now looking at the result
                            of
                            this:
                            our very own
                            webstore, making it possible to order Bethany's delicious pies whenever you feel like it!
